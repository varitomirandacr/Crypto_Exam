## Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSR)
A standard way of producing a binary stream of data is to use a feedback shift register. These are small circuits containing a number of memory cells, each of which holds one bit of information. The set of such cells forms a register. In each cycle a certain predefined set of cells are “tapped” and their value is passed through a function, called the feedback function.

- Each state is obtained from previous state, via matrix multiplication
- Outputting bits produces a vector product (s = 0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1)
- The register is the combination of tapped bits, length = $L$
- The output sequence is then defined to be s0,s1,s2,...,sL−1,sL,sL+1,... where for $j ≥ L$ we have:
$$ s_{j} = c_{1} ·s_{j−1} \oplus c_{2} ·s_{j−2} \oplus ··· \oplus c_{L} ·s_{j−L} $$

## Connection Polynomial
The connection polynomial and the matrix are related via
$$ 𝐶(𝑋)=1+𝑐_{1} ⋅𝑋+𝑐_{2} ⋅𝑋^{2} + . . . + 𝑐_{𝐿} ⋅𝑋^{𝐿} $$
$$ C(X) = det(X \cdot M − I_{L}) $$
$$ \in 𝔽_{2}[𝑋] $$
$$ reverse \ = \ G(X) = X^{L} · C(1/X)$$

```
Connection Polynomial = $X^{2} + 1$

A connection polynomial $𝐶(𝑋)$ is primitive if
- it is irreducible, and
- a root $\theta$ generates the multiplicative group of the field $𝔽_{2𝑛}$

A connection polynomial $𝐶(𝑋)$ is primitive if 
- $𝔽_{2}[𝑋]/(𝐶(𝑋)) = 𝔽_{2}(\theta) = 𝔽_{2𝑛}, and$
- $𝔽_{2𝑛}^{*} =⟨\theta⟩$

## Linear Complexity
An important measure of the cryptographic quality of a sequence.
We define the linear complexity of $s$ as $L(s)$ where:
- $L(s) = 0$ if s is the zero sequence
- $L(s) = ∞$ if no LFSR generates s
- $L(s)$ is the length of the shortest LFSR to generate s, otherwise.

Properties:
- For all $n \geq 1$ we have $0 \leq L(s^{n}) \leq n$
- If $s$ is periodic with period $N$ then $L(s) \leq N$
- $L(s\oplus t) \leq L(s)+L(t)$

## Combining LFSRs
To obtain greater security a common practice is to use a number, say n, of LFSRs, each producing a different output sequence $x_{1}^{(i)}, . . . , x_{n}^{(i)}$. The key is then the initial state of all of the LFSRs

$$ f(x1,x2,x3,x4,x5) = 1\oplus x2 \oplus x3 \oplus (x4 ·x5)\oplus (x1 ·x2 ·x3 ·x5) $$

Amazing fact is that the linear complexity of the keystream generated by $f(x_{1},...,x_{n})$ is equal to $f(L_{1},...,L_{n})$

**Theorem (Linear Complexity of Combined LFSRs)**
Let $𝑓(𝑥_{1}, ... , 𝑥_{𝑛})$ be a non-linear function and 
- $𝑛$ LFSRs generated by a primitive connection polynomial 
- each $𝐿_{𝑖} > 2 (1 \leq 𝑖 \leq 𝑛)$
- each $𝐿_{𝑖} \neq 𝐿_{𝑗} (𝑖 \neq 𝑗)$
then, $𝐿(𝑓)=𝑓(𝐿_{1},...,𝐿{𝑛})$ with $\oplus $ and⋅in $𝔽_{2}$ replaced by+ and⋅in $Z$

## Recovering the State
Shift register recursion:
$$ \sum_{i=1}^{L} c_{i} \cdot s_{j-i} = s_{j}, j \geq L$$
where $c_{0} = 1$
$$ \sum_{i=0}^{L} c_{i} \cdot s_{j-i} = 0, j \geq L$$

Given $2𝐿$ outputs (i.e., $𝑠^{2𝐿}$), we can recover $𝑐_{1}, ... , 𝑐_{𝐿}$ by solving: Matrix multiplications of C's by Matrix of states

## RC4 Stream Cipher: No LFSRs
Ron’s Cipher after Ron Rivest of MIT

- RC4 not previous version neither related to RC5 and RC6
- very fast stream cipher
- easy to remember since it is surprisingly simple
- widely deployed in browsers to secure traffic to websites using the TLS protocol

Issues:
- Not really random
- In particular, each output byte has a particular bias
- RC4 should no longer be used

How it works:
- RC4 we take an array S, indexed from 0 to 255, consisting of the integers 0, . . . , 255
- The output of the RC4 algorithm is a keystream of bytes K which is exclusive-or’ed with the plaintext byte by byte
- i = 0 and j = 0, then repeat steps
$$
i←(i+1) mod256 \\
j←(j+Si) mod256 \\ 
swap(Si,Sj) \\ 
t←(Si+Sj) mod256 \\
K ← St.
$$

if the attacker knows K and i, he can deduce the value of St, but this does not allow him to deduce anything about the internal state of the table
